For the analyzer you will need:
'pypiwin32' for searching the reqistry (pip install pywin32)
'requests' for using http methods and interacting with websites (pip install requests)
using SSL verification requires correct certificates
It seems that the website used for parsing licences changed their post response
'webbrowser' for opening a html file in a new browser window or tab (might actually be default)
'beautifulsoup4' for parsing html files (pip install beautifulsoup4)

For the GUI:
pyside2
pyqt5
